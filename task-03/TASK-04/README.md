Task-04

This task was competitive as it's name suggests. Even though I come from a computer science background, this task was  definitely challenging. It made me think a lot. I couldn't complete the task as the rest of the 5 questions were a bit hard. I'm sure I would have been able to crack it if time permitted. But due to time constraints, couldn't do so. But like all other tasks, it was knowledgable.
