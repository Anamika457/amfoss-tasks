# amfoss-tasks

## SELF INTRO

Hey guys!!<br>
I'm Anamika V Menon, a first year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering in Amrita,Amritapuri. I'm from Thrissur,Kerala. I've always loved to code and the things we can do by clicking a few buttons on our computers has never ceased to amaze me. The more I dive deep into the world of coding, the more I'm pulled in. I've always loved to learn new things and I'm eager;y looking forward to all the new journeys I can embark here.


## INTROSPECTION


### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I come from a Computer Science background. And coding and solving problems have always thrilled me. I'm dedicated to my work and won't give up if I hit a wall. I won't say I'm the best but I can assure that I would try my level best to complete any task and will stay committed to what I'm doing. I'm always looking for new ways to grow and amfoss is the perfect opportunity for me. Even doing the tasks to get in made me learn a lot and I can't imagine how much I can grow I get into the club. Rest assured, I would give my all to the club if presented the chance.


### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?

Doing the amfoss tasks had made me realize that there's much that I do not know, the vast world of coding and technology that awaits me. That excites me even more. So in general I plan on sharpening my coding skills and learning whatever I can about all the different programming languages that I got introduced to while doing the tasks. I would also focus on web development as from doing the tasks, I understood that I enjoy creating stuff. So I definitely plan on learing more about that.


### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

I will do my level best to help the club and it's mebers for anything. I will also try my best to be of help to my juniors, to aid them, if given the chance. Whatever the work is, I'm ready to give my all and that, I assure you.


### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?

The tasks provided a huge opportunity to everyone to  learn a lot of new stuff. Whether or not I get selected, I'm really glad I attempted to solve these tasks as they provided me with a lot of knowledge and exposure that I would've missed had I not attempted. To come to the selection process, some tasks I definitely found them hard. But all of them were really interesting to do and I can't fathom the world I would be introduced if I get into the club.
